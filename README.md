## Technology

We used React.Js, React-Router-Dom, React-Icon, Framer-motion, Swiper and Sass-loader to develop the app. 

## Implementation

We render everything functionally with different React-components, and with the use of "useContext" we are able to share the needed information between all our components.

All the selected ingredients will be saved in the local-storage of the user.
