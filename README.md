# PizzaVerse

Tired of having the same pizza options? PizzaVerse is here to change that. In PizzaVerse you'll be able to customize your pizza to your own desire. 5 simple steps, confirm your selection and voila! Your pizza will be ready in 30 mts. for pickup.

## Technology

We used React.Js, React-Router-Dom, React-Icon, Framer-motion, Swiper and Sass-loader to develop the app. 

## Implementation

We render our functionally in components, where the hook useContext allowed to share the desire data between the components saved in the local storage of the user.
